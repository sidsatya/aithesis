    "IBM Watson was introduced in 2006, and had its first commercial use with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Center for Cancer Research in 2013. Thus, I will use the year 2013 as the treatment year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the capabilities of Watson with Natural Language Processing, Question and Answering, and Speech Recognition, the jobs it would likely immediately effect upon the introduction of commercial artificial intelligence usage would be jobs that require mechanical Q&A and scheduling work, such as Telemarketers. This is an example of substituting capital for labor in prediction tasks (Automating Prediction Tasks), as the appropriate response to a question is predicted. On the other hand, managerial positions and jobs focused on decision tasks, such as paralegal work, and financial managers \n",
    "\n",
    "In September 2011, IBM and WellPoint (now Anthem) announced a partnership to utilize Watson's data crunching capability to help suggest treatment options to physicians.[98] Then, in February 2013, IBM and WellPoint gave Watson its first commercial application, for utilization management decisions in lung cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center.[9]\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I can look at wages and employment for medical assistants, secretaries, and physicians and surgeons before and after 2013, which is when AI started to be used commercially within the medical industry. These jobs will have to be restricted to the medical industry \n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis is that wages will increase for medical assistants and secretaries while employment falls. This is because those that can handle the technology will be paid more, but also more efficient. This is an example of substituting capital for labor. Furthermore, I would hypothesize that there will be a slight increase in wages and an ambiguous effect on employment for physicians and surgeons. This is because their jobs are augmented by AI, but most of the central tasks remain the same, so the technology hasn't reached a point where it can displace some major tasks.\n",

    "Y_ot is outcome variable for occupation o in time t. T1 and T2 are dummies for pre and post periods. AI_ot is an indicator = 1 if the job is one related to Automating Prediction Tasks and 0 otherwise. Post_ot is an indicator = 1 if in the post period of the treatment. Educ is the mean years of education for each occupation."

Then, regress outcomes for low-skill and high-skill in a DiD approach, using Watson as treatment. I can introduce occupation-level variables this way, such as mean education. I can also include industry fixed effects. This would give an insight into potential changes in low skill and high skill labor in the medical industry."
