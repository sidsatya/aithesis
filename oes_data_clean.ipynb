    "**Challenges with Using OES Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Changes in Occupational Classification:** \n",
    "The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) changed in different periods: old SOC (through 1998), 2000 SOC, 2010 SOC, and 2017 SOC. Certain occupations have been aggregated and condensed in different ways from the 2010 SOC to the 2017 SOC. Details here: https://www.bls.gov/oes/changes_2017.htm. Luckily, none of these changes seem to have affected the Finance and Insurance industry from the years 2010-2019. Thus, we can eliminate this worry for this specific industry. **WILL NEED TO CHECK THIS FOR NEW INDUSTRIES**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Changes in Industrial Classification:**\n",
    "The NAICS classifications for different indistries has changed over time, which the OES follows. https://www.bls.gov/oes/changes_2017.htm. Unfortunately, NAICS code 523 became more refined in May 2017, with different jobs within the securities and commodity contracts jobs being more finely detailed. Otherwise, there are not any other aggregations in the 2017 issue that would affect this. There have also been changes in classification in 2008, 2012, and 2017. I will need to check for this for different occupations and ensure that their classification has not changed between 2008-2019 and if so, aggregate accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Changes in Geographical Classification:**\n",
    "These are changes regarding geographical metrics that can be found in the OES data. This does not concern my analysis right now, but if it does, then I will have to revisit this point. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Changes in the Survey Reference Period:**\n",
    "In 2002, the reference months for the OES survey were changed from October, November, and December to May and November in order to reduce seasonal influences. Industries or occupations that have seasonal employment variations between the two sets of reference months will show employment shifts due to the change in the time of year the data were collected. Since I am only looking at a time frame between 2008 and 2019, this should not be a concern. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Changes in mean wage estimation methodology:**\n",
    "In 2002, the method of calculating mean wages was changed for occupations with any workers earning above 70 dollars per hour in order to remove a downward bias in mean wage estimates. The result of this change may be seen as higher mean wage estimates for some occupations. However, the median and percentile wage estimates would not be affected by this change. Again, since I am only looking at a time frame between 2008 and 2019, this should not be a concern. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Permanent features of OES methodology:**\n",
    "It is difficult to make comparisons of OES data across short time periods due to the moving-average window approach over a 3-year period to make estimates. However, I am looking at estimates over a 10-year period, so this should not be a large concern. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assuming that the above 6 caveats with the OES data are addressed, it should be safe to use the survey data to construct multiple time series for analysis**"
